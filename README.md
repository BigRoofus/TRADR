# TRADR

TRADR is an app designed to make you better at day-trading US stocks.

It features advanced order types, allowing for more advanced strategies, such as those seen in DMA software like DAS Trader.

## Buy
Buy at the current price.  These can be stacked to trade in bigger proportions.
## Sell
## Short-Sell
## Flat All, 50%, or 25%
## Reverse
## Replay
It also features a Replay option, where you can quickly replay the last few bars of price action, as sometimes watching a chart move gives you more of a feeling for what's happening than seeing it frozen in time.
