# TRADR

TRADR is an app designed to make you better at day trading US stocks.

It features more advanced types of orders as seen in DMA (Direct Market Access) software such as DAS Trader:

Short-sell<br>
Flat all, 50%, or 25%<br>
Reverse<br>

It also features a Replay option, where you can quickly replay the last few bars of price action, as sometimes watching a chart move gives you more clues than seeing it frozen in time.

Currently it is functional, though there is a lot more I want to do with it.
