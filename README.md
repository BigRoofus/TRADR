# TRADR

TRADR is an app designed to make you better at day-trading US stocks.

It features more advanced types of orders, such as those seen in DMA (Direct Market Access) software such as DAS Trader:

Buy<br>
Sell<br>
Short-Sell<br>
Flat All, 50%, or 25%<br>
Reverse<br>

It also features a Replay option, where you can quickly replay the last few bars of price action, as sometimes watching a chart move gives you more of a feeling for what's happening than seeing it frozen in time.

Currently it is functional, though there is a lot more that needs to be done.

TODO:<br>
Modularize code<br>
Create Trade History panel<br>
Create Trade Analysis panel<br>
Set up Firebase DB to save stats, accounts, etc<br>
