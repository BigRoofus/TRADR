# TRADR

TRADR is an app designed to make you better at day trading US stocks.

It features more advanced types of orders as seen in DMA (Direct Market Access) software such as DAS Trader:
Short-sell
Flat all, 50%, or 25%
Reverse

Currently it is functional, though there is a lot more I want to do with it.
